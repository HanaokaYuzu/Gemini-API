The calculation requires finding the block's final velocity as it leaves the belt. The process can be broken down into three distinct phases.\\n\\n***\\n\\n### Phase 1: Block Accelerates (0 to 1 s)\\n\\nInitially, the block ($v_0 \\u003d 5 \\\\text{ m/s}$) is slower than the belt ($v_{belt} \\u003d 6 \\\\text{ m/s}$). The kinetic friction force acts in the forward direction, causing the block to accelerate.\\n\\n1.  **Friction Force ($f_k$):** The force is calculated as $f_k \\u003d \\\\mu N \\u003d \\\\mu mg$.\\n    $f_k \\u003d 0.1 \\\\times 10 \\\\text{ kg} \\\\times 10 \\\\text{ m/s}^2 \\u003d 10 \\\\text{ N}$\\n\\n2.  **Acceleration ($a_1$):** From Newton's second law, $F \\u003d ma$.\\n    $a_1 \\u003d \\\\frac{f_k}{m} \\u003d \\\\frac{10 \\\\text{ N}}{10 \\\\text{ kg}} \\u003d 1 \\\\text{ m/s}^2$\\n\\n3.  **Time to Match Belt Speed ($t_1$):** We find the time it takes for the block to reach the belt's speed.\\n    $v_{belt} \\u003d v_0 + a_1 t_1$\\n    $6 \\\\text{ m/s} \\u003d 5 \\\\text{ m/s} + (1 \\\\text{ m/s}^2) t_1$\\n    $t_1 \\u003d 1 \\\\text{ s}$\\n\\n4.  **Distance Covered ($d_1$):**\\n    $d_1 \\u003d v_0 t_1 + \\\\frac{1}{2} a_1 t_1^2 \\u003d (5)(1) + \\\\frac{1}{2}(1)(1)^2 \\u003d 5.5 \\\\text{ m}$\\n\\n***\\n\\n### Phase 2: Block Moves with the Belt (1 s to 13/12 s)\\n\\nFor the interval between $t \\u003d 1 \\\\text{ s}$ and when the belt stops at $t \\u003d 13/12 \\\\text{ s}$, the block moves at the same velocity as the belt ($6 \\\\text{ m/s}$). There is no relative motion, so the kinetic friction force is zero.\\n\\n1.  **Time Duration ($\\\\Delta t_2$):**\\n    $\\\\Delta t_2 \\u003d \\\\frac{13}{12} \\\\text{ s} - 1 \\\\text{ s} \\u003d \\\\frac{1}{12} \\\\text{ s}$\\n\\n2.  **Distance Covered ($d_2$):**\\n    $d_2 \\u003d v_{belt} \\\\times \\\\Delta t_2 \\u003d 6 \\\\text{ m/s} \\\\times \\\\frac{1}{12} \\\\text{ s} \\u003d 0.5 \\\\text{ m}$\\n\\nAt the end of this phase, the block's velocity is $v_{start\\\\_phase3} \\u003d 6 \\\\text{ m/s}$, and the total distance traveled is $d_{total\\\\_1,2} \\u003d d_1 + d_2 \\u003d 5.5 + 0.5 \\u003d 6 \\\\text{ m}$.\\n\\n***\\n\\n### Phase 3: Belt Stops and Block Decelerates\\n\\nAt $t \\u003d 13/12 \\\\text{ s}$, the belt stops. The block continues to move forward, now with a velocity of $6 \\\\text{ m/s}$ relative to a stationary belt. The friction force now opposes the motion, causing deceleration.\\n\\n1.  **Acceleration ($a_3$):** The friction force has the same magnitude ($10 \\\\text{ N}$) but now acts in the opposite direction.\\n    $a_3 \\u003d \\\\frac{-f_k}{m} \\u003d \\\\frac{-10 \\\\text{ N}}{10 \\\\text{ kg}} \\u003d -1 \\\\text{ m/s}^2$\\n\\n2.  **Remaining Distance ($d_3$):** The block has to travel the rest of the belt's length.\\n    $d_3 \\u003d L - d_{total\\\\_1,2} \\u003d 11.5 \\\\text{ m} - 6 \\\\text{ m} \\u003d 5.5 \\\\text{ m}$\\n\\n3.  **Final Velocity ($v_f$):** We use kinematics to find the block's velocity as it slides off the end of the belt.\\n    $v_f^2 \\u003d v_{start\\\\_phase3}^2 + 2 a_3 d_3$\\n    $v_f^2 \\u003d (6 \\\\text{ m/s})^2 + 2(-1 \\\\text{ m/s}^2)(5.5 \\\\text{ m})$\\n    $v_f^2 \\u003d 36 - 11 \\u003d 25$\\n    $v_f \\u003d \\\\sqrt{25} \\u003d 5 \\\\text{ m/s}$\\n\\n***\\n\\n### Total Impulse Calculation\\n\\nThe total impulse ($J_{total}$) is the change in momentum from the very beginning ($v_i \\u003d v_0 \\u003d 5 \\\\text{ m/s}$) to the very end ($v_f \\u003d 5 \\\\text{ m/s}$).\\n\\n$J_{total} \\u003d \\\\Delta p \\u003d m v_f - m v_i$\\n$J_{total} \\u003d (10 \\\\text{ kg})(5 \\\\text{ m/s}) - (10 \\\\text{ kg})(5 \\\\text{ m/s})$\\n$J_{total} \\u003d 50 \\\\text{ N}\\\\cdot\\\\text{s} - 50 \\\\text{ N}\\\\cdot\\\\text{s} \\u003d \\\\textbf{0 N·s}$\"],[],null,null,null,true,null,[1],\"en\",null,null,[null,null,null,null,null,null,[0],[]],null,null,true,null,null,null,null,null,[false],null,false,[],true,null,null,[],null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,[[\"**Defining the Objective**\\n\\nI'm currently focused on dissecting the user's request.

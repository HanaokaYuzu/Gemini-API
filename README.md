## Installation

> [!NOTE]
>
> This package requires Python 3.10 or higher.

Install/update the package with pip.

```bash
pip install -U gemini_webapi
```

Optionally, package offers a way to automatically import cookies from your local browser. To enable this feature, install `browser-cookie3` as well. Supported platforms and browsers can be found [here](https://github.com/borisbabic/browser_cookie3?tab=readme-ov-file#contribute).

```bash
pip install -U browser-cookie3
```

## Authentication

> [!TIP]
>
> If `browser-cookie3` is installed, you can skip this step and go directly to [usage](#usage) section. Just make sure you have logged in to <https://gemini.google.com> in your browser.

- Go to <https://gemini.google.com> and login with your Google account
- Press F12 for web inspector, go to `Network` tab and refresh the page
- Click any request and copy cookie values of `__Secure-1PSID` and `__Secure-1PSIDTS`

> [!NOTE]
>
> If your application is deployed in a containerized environment (e.g. Docker), you may want to persist the cookies with a volume to avoid re-authentication every time the container rebuilds.
>
> Here's part of a sample `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
services:
    main:
        volumes:
            - ./gemini_cookies:/usr/local/lib/python3.12/site-packages/gemini_webapi/utils/temp
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> API's auto cookie refreshing feature doesn't require `browser-cookie3`, and by default is enabled. It allows you to keep the API service running without worrying about cookie expiration.
>
> This feature may cause that you need to re-login to your Google account in the browser. This is an expected behavior and won't affect the API's functionality.
>
> To avoid such result, it's recommended to get cookies from a separate browser session and close it as asap for best utilization (e.g. a fresh login in browser's private mode). More details can be found [here](https://github.com/HanaokaYuzu/Gemini-API/issues/6).

## Usage

### Initialization

Import required packages and initialize a client with your cookies obtained from the previous step. After a successful initialization, the API will automatically refresh `__Secure-1PSIDTS` in background as long as the process is alive.

```python
import asyncio
from gemini_webapi import GeminiClient

# Replace "COOKIE VALUE HERE" with your actual cookie values.
# Leave Secure_1PSIDTS empty if it's not available for your account.
Secure_1PSID = "COOKIE VALUE HERE"
Secure_1PSIDTS = "COOKIE VALUE HERE"

async def main():
    # If browser-cookie3 is installed, simply use `client = GeminiClient()`
    client = GeminiClient(Secure_1PSID, Secure_1PSIDTS, proxy=None)
    await client.init(timeout=30, auto_close=False, close_delay=300, auto_refresh=False)

asyncio.run(main())
```

> [!TIP]
>
> `auto_close` and `close_delay` are optional arguments for automatically closing the client after a certain period of inactivity. This feature is disabled by default. In an always-on service like chatbot, it's recommended to set `auto_close` to `True` combined with reasonable seconds of `close_delay` for better resource management.

### Select language model

You can specify which language model to use by passing `model` argument to `GeminiClient.generate_content` or `GeminiClient.start_chat`. The default value is `unspecified`.

Currently available models (as of Feb 5, 2025):

- `unspecified` - Default model (same as `gemini-2.0-flash` if account does NOT have Gemini Advanced subscription)
- `gemini-2.0-flash` - Gemini 2.0 Flash
- `gemini-2.0-flash-thinking` - Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental
- `gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-with-apps` - Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental with apps
- `gemini-1.5-flash` - Gemini 1.5 Flash

Models pending update (may not work as expected):

- `gemini-2.0-exp-advanced` - Gemini 2.0 Experimental Advanced **(requires Gemini Advanced account)**
- `gemini-1.5-pro` - Gemini 1.5 Pro **(requires Gemini Advanced account)**
- `gemini-1.5-pro-research` - Gemini 1.5 Pro with Deep Research **(requires Gemini Advanced account)**

```python
from gemini_webapi.constants import Model

async def main():
    response1 = await client.generate_content(
        "What's you language model version? Reply version number only.",
        model=Model.G_2_0_FLASH,
    )
    print(f"Model version ({Model.G_2_0_FLASH.model_name}): {response1.text}")

    chat = client.start_chat(model="gemini-2.0-flash-thinking")
    response2 = await chat.send_message("What's you language model version? Reply version number only.")
    print(f"Model version (gemini-2.0-flash-thinking): {response2.text}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Generate contents from text

Ask a one-turn quick question by calling `GeminiClient.generate_content`.

```python
async def main():
    response = await client.generate_content("Hello World!")
    print(response.text)

asyncio.run(main())
```

> [!TIP]
>
> Simply use `print(response)` to get the same output if you just want to see the response text

### Generate contents from image

Gemini supports image recognition and generating contents from images. Optionally, you can pass images in a list of file data in `bytes` or their paths in `str` or `pathlib.Path` to `GeminiClient.generate_content` together with text prompt.

```python
async def main():
    response = await client.generate_content(
            "Describe each of these images",
            images=["assets/banner.png", "assets/favicon.png"],
        )
    print(response.text)

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Conversations across multiple turns

If you want to keep conversation continuous, please use `GeminiClient.start_chat` to create a `ChatSession` object and send messages through it. The conversation history will be automatically handled and get updated after each turn.

```python
async def main():
    chat = client.start_chat()
    response1 = await chat.send_message("Briefly introduce Europe")
    response2 = await chat.send_message("What's the population there?")
    print(response1.text, response2.text, sep="\n\n----------------------------------\n\n")

asyncio.run(main())
```

> [!TIP]
>
> Same as `GeminiClient.generate_content`, `ChatSession.send_message` also accepts `image` as an optional argument.

### Continue previous conversations

To manually retrieve previous conversations, you can pass previous `ChatSession`'s metadata to `GeminiClient.start_chat` when creating a new `ChatSession`. Alternatively, you can persist previous metadata to a file or db if you need to access them after the current Python process has exited.

```python
async def main():
    # Start a new chat session
    chat = client.start_chat()
    response = await chat.send_message("Fine weather today")

    # Save chat's metadata
    previous_session = chat.metadata

    # Load the previous conversation
    previous_chat = client.start_chat(metadata=previous_session)
    response = await previous_chat.send_message("What was my previous message?")
    print(response)

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Retrieve model's thought process

When using models with thinking capabilities, the model's thought process will be populated in `ModelOutput.thoughts`.

```python
async def main():
    response = await client.generate_content(
            "What's 1+1?", model="gemini-2.0-flash-thinking"
        )
    print(response.thoughts)
    print(response.text)

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Retrieve images in response

Images in the API's output are stored as a list of `Image` objects. You can access the image title, URL, and description by calling `image.title`, `image.url` and `image.alt` respectively.

```python
async def main():
    response = await client.generate_content("Send me some pictures of cats")
    for image in response.images:
        print(image, "\n\n----------------------------------\n")

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Generate images with ImageFx

In February 2022, Google introduced a new AI image generator called ImageFx and integrated it into Gemini. You can ask Gemini to generate images with ImageFx simply by natural language.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Google has some limitations on the image generation feature in Gemini, so its availability could be different per region/account. Here's a summary copied from [official documentation](https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/14286560) (as of February 15th, 2024):
>
> > Image generation in Gemini Apps is available in most countries, except in the European Economic Area (EEA), Switzerland, and the UK. It’s only available for **English prompts**.
> >
> > This feature’s availability in any specific Gemini app is also limited to the supported languages and countries of that app.
> >
> > For now, this feature isn’t available to users under 18.

```python
async def main():
    response = await client.generate_content("Generate some pictures of cats")
    for image in response.images:
        print(image, "\n\n----------------------------------\n")

asyncio.run(main())
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> by default, when asked to send images (like the previous example), Gemini will send images fetched from web instead of generating images with AI model, unless you specifically require to "generate" images in your prompt. In this package, web images and generated images are treated differently as `WebImage` and `GeneratedImage`, and will be automatically categorized in the output.

### Save images to local files

You can save images returned from Gemini to local files under `/temp` by calling `Image.save()`. Optionally, you can specify the file path and file name by passing `path` and `filename` arguments to the function and skip images with invalid file names by passing `skip_invalid_filename=True`. Works for both `WebImage` and `GeneratedImage`.

```python
async def main():
    response = await client.generate_content("Generate some pictures of cats")
    for i, image in enumerate(response.images):
        await image.save(path="temp/", filename=f"cat_{i}.png", verbose=True)

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Generate contents with Gemini extensions

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> To access Gemini extensions in API, you must activate them on the [Gemini website](https://gemini.google.com/extensions) first. Same as image generation, Google also has limitations on the availability of Gemini extensions. Here's a summary copied from [official documentation](https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/13695044) (as of February 18th, 2024):
>
> > To use extensions in Gemini Apps:
> >
> > Sign in with your personal Google Account that you manage on your own. Extensions, including the Google Workspace extension, are currently not available to Google Workspace accounts for school, business, or other organizations.
> >
> > Have Gemini Apps Activity on. Extensions are only available when Gemini Apps Activity is turned on.
> >
> > Important: For now, extensions are available in **English, Japanese, and Korean** only.

After activating extensions for your account, you can access them in your prompts either by natural language or by starting your prompt with "@" followed by the extension keyword.

```python
async def main():
    response1 = await client.generate_content("@Gmail What's the latest message in my mailbox?")
    print(response1, "\n\n----------------------------------\n")

    response2 = await client.generate_content("@Youtube What's the latest activity of Taylor Swift?")
    print(response2, "\n\n----------------------------------\n")

asyncio.run(main())
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> For the available regions limitation, it actually only requires your Google account's **preferred language** to be set to one of the three supported languages listed above. You can change your language settings [here](https://myaccount.google.com/language).

### Check and switch to other reply candidates

A response from Gemini usually contains multiple reply candidates with different generated contents. You can check all candidates and choose one to continue the conversation. By default, the first candidate will be chosen automatically.

```python
async def main():
    # Start a conversation and list all reply candidates
    chat = client.start_chat()
    response = await chat.send_message("Recommend a science fiction book for me.")
    for candidate in response.candidates:
        print(candidate, "\n\n----------------------------------\n")

    if len(response.candidates) > 1:
        # Control the ongoing conversation flow by choosing candidate manually
        new_candidate = chat.choose_candidate(index=1)  # Choose the second candidate here
        followup_response = await chat.send_message("Tell me more about it.")  # Will generate contents based on the chosen candidate
        print(new_candidate, followup_response, sep="\n\n----------------------------------\n\n")
    else:
        print("Only one candidate available.")

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Control log level

You can set the log level of the package to one of the following values: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR` and `CRITICAL`. The default value is `INFO`.

```python
from gemini_webapi import set_log_level

set_log_level("DEBUG")
```
